# Research Links

This repo will keep my saved links which I've found during research and want to remember for potential future reference.
It will likely go through phases of being curated and organized vs having links just dumped in when I realize I have
too many browser tabs open and need to close them all but save what's interesting.

I'm currently keeping the following separate pages for each technology.

## Link Collections

* [AWS](./LINKS-AWS.md)
* [Azure](./LINKS-Azure.md)
* [Terraform](./LINKS-Terraform.md)
* [Apple](./LINKS-Apple.md)
* [Microsoft](./LINKS-Microsoft.md)
